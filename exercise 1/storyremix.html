      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p> really wierd. my boyfriend became artistic and couldn't stop talking about the ecstatic flow of paint after he came back from the war. few truths about paint are more basic than this: it tends to go on wet, whether on canvas, furniture or
        builldings, and then it dries.
        once dried, it can preserve a sense of its original fluidity to greatly varying degrees. in the postwar years it became
        a sure sign of modernity and freshness.it's dynamic, at times voclnic, like artistic genius is supposed to be, but it can
        also have a comedic, even ironic quality. it conveys immediacy, material reality, improvisation as well as flamboyance
        andglamour, savoir faire. giving full voice to the liquidity of paint has gone in and out of style since it was liberated
        in the 1940s by the drip paintings of jACKSON pOLLOCK, janet Sobel and Norman lewis.In the mid-1950s, Helen Frankenthaler
        opened further possibilities. working on the floor, she thinned her paint to the consistency of water, creating floods
        and eddies of color that soaked into the canvas.her techniques established the color fireld school in the united states.
        The Japanese artists of the Gutai took wetness to fabulous excesses, amking it a lavalike substance. things turned ironic
        with andy warhol's oxidation series, achieved by the artist and others urinaning on canvases painted with copper metallic paint.

      <p>He looks like a psycho. he hasn't say a single word for a week. he just looked at me when i talked to him, and he barely did gestures. Enough. i'm done with him.
