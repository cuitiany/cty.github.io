      <br>  Hi~ I am Tianyi. You can also call me Cheryl. I was born and raised in China. Studying broad in the United States is a completely new experience to me. I am a senior student in University of California - Davis, majoring in design and minoring in Textile and Clothing.
      I was going to minoring in Managerial Economics too, since I'm also interested infashion management or fashion marketing. However, proved by fact, economics is definitely not my thing, so I decided to just stay with my major and give up the marketing road.
      It turned out, putting more time and effort on fashion design is a right choice. Not only did my skills improve, I also became much more lighthearted because I never need to stay up late struggling about supplies and demands again. </p>
