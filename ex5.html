<h2>description
</h2>
<p>Designed by Vernon Adams in 2011, Monoton is a pure display webfont meant to be used at font sizes above 30 points. Monoton has been designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices. While this font is not legible when used in body text, we find it very stylish; it gives off retro vibe and reminds people of disco in the 1970s. </p>

<h2>usage
</h2>
<p>Google Fonts API served Monoton over 40.8 million times last week, and it is featured in more than 230,000 websites. It is also often used for poster designs.
